# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-STORE-SALES-
Problem Statement:
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in 
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data 
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and 
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more 
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.
Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine 
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the 
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.
